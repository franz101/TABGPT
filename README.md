# TABGPT
## Ask once, get all model answers! ðŸ¤–
I was tired of tab switching between different models and copy pasting the question.
So I made one interface to rule them all! ðŸ§™

## How do I use it?
Download the Folder and load it into Chrome Extension, activate the sidebar by clicking the extension icon and ask your question ðŸš€
